                <h3>Tacoma 311 Issues Dashboard</h3>
                <p>After noticing how long it took to have the city address issues in my community, I turned to see what data I could collect on our city's 311 activity. This helped me understand the problems faced by Tacoma and which areas face greater challenges, receive less attention, and generally experience greater stress. This data has enabled me to have better conversations and speak to our challenges.</p>
